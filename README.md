SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT BRIEFI. Module Learning Outcomes 
The module learning outcomes for this module are as follows:
MLO 1.   Identify an individual research project within the area of specialism of the degree programme. 
MLO 2.   Apply knowledge of research philosophy and methods to justify an appropriate approach for a specific research question. 
MLO 3.   Critically analyse significant bodies of literature in the chosen topic area to justify an area of research. 
MLO 4.   Develop a research plan for a researchable problem. 
MLO 5.   Identify and address ethical issues associated with a specific piece of research, and attain ethical approval for the project. 
This assessment addresses all the module learning outcomes listed above.
II. Assessment Background/Scenario 
The foundation of any project lies in the planning, and assessment of its viability as a project. Fundamentally, this is what the research proposal concerns itself with and helps ascertain whether the final project is worth planning for.
In the formative assessment you were asked to present 2 project ideas; at this stage you will need to eliminate one of these ideas and select the project idea you wish to take forward for your summative assignment submission. This idea now needs to be planned in sufficient depth in order to present a viable project proposal.
Choosing a project and writing a proposal are all part of the foundations of a project. Your proposal is the preparation for your project - a deficiency in this area can cause a project to fail.
III. Assessment Task 
For the summative assessment you need to produce a 3,000-word, written research proposal which may later be used to inform. your Independent Research Project (IRP).
The word counts and indicative structure below are what we think a typical proposal requires; however, you may choose to allocate your word count differently. You should remember to be succinct and precise, and that quantity does not imply quality.

IV. Deliverables 
Your assignment should be laid out following the formatting guidelines that are specified in the ‘Submission Formatting’ page in Canvas. This includes restrictions on the length of the appendices, expectations on how your work should be presented and any penalties when these expectations are not met.
Your report should not exceed 3,000 words in total and consist of clear sections to address the main task. Your response to one section will not contribute to grades in another. Further formatting details and essential points are given below.
·   Your submission must include a cover sheet and a table of contents. 
o   The cover sheet should include: 
§   the module name and module code; 
§   the title of your submission.  
NOTE: To ensure your work is marked anonymously, do not put any identifying information, such as name, exam number or student ID, on your submission (including the cover sheet). Please refer to the Summative Assessment Policies page for guidance on anonymising your submission.
Referencing
You are required to use the IEEE referencing style for citing books, articles, and all other sources (like websites) used in your assignment.
Good referencing is essential in order to meet the standards of academic integrity set by the University. All of your sources must be acknowledged, regardless of whether you included direct quotes or not. Visit your Academic Integrity Tutorial module in Canvas for additional guidance on effective referencing.
V. Marking Criteria 
Address all of the relevant parts of the Proposal, making note of the word count limit. Any parts of your proposal that go beyond the limit will not be marked. Any references or other sources used must be listed at the end of the document and do not count towards the word count.
These are expected in your proposal and constitute what you are marked on.
